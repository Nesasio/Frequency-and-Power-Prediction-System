# Frequency and Scheduled Power Prediction System
Frequency and Scheduled Power Prediction System is a forecasting tool made with MATLAB to help in predicting frequency of the electrical grid and the scheduled power generation of the power plant.
The real time frequency data, scheduled power data and actual power data is extracted from [UP load dispatch centre](https://www.upsldc.org/real-time-data) website.

In context of a thermal power plant, scheduled power is the power generation which is to be maintained by the plant in accordance with the power demand, costs and various other factors. This scheduled power value for a particular time in a day is assigned to the plant around 2 blocks in advance. A block in this context is a period of 15 minutes starting from 0000 hours, meaning the block number is 1 from 0000 to 0015 hours on any particular day. This prediction tool therefore, predicts the scheduled power value of next block to aid in better power management of the power plant.
